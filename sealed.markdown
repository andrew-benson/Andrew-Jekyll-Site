This is a collection I have amassed over the years via eBay mainly, it's an expensive hobby so I do not recommend it to anyone.
Showing all of my sealed games to someone takes a few hours so it's the main driver for this blog to exist, I know this because I did it once. It was exhausting.

I finally have a place where I can have a look at my games collection without having to climb on to wobbly stool just to pull them all out (and risk it falling on top of me in the process). Please have a browse, see any favourites?
