# Notes

This release contains two expansions 

- Chains of Promathia
- Rise of the Zilart

Can't say I've ever played this Final Fantasy title, I just bought it a long time ago for the sake of continuing the Final Fantasy Collection.
Supposedly a great, long lasted PS2 and PC game, and was the last game to be supported via the PS2 online feature. To think 
this title was played up until 2016 is an amazing feat, and still continues to be played on the PC platform today. I never used the PS2 for online at all but 
I know the ethernet adapters are used for modding the fat PS2 with a HDD- I've done this myself, it feels like you're installing an emulator on your PS2, in contrast to the swap disc method which requires you to burn your own discs off.  

# Condition

No yellowing of the cardboard box. Seal remains intact all around. Box seems to have been squashed at some point resulting some creases left and right side of the box. There is also a slight groove on the back-left side where the box has been under some pressure. Overall good condition.
