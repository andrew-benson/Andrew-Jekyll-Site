# Notes

My second favourite Final Fantasy of all time has to go to this installment of the series.
In my opinion this game is still very playable today - it's aged well, I can't say the same for Final Fantasy VII. This game had everything - story, music, gameplay and by the way how
good was the card game!? 

Admittedly I haven't finished this game entirely, I've tried to play through about 3 times in the past 15 years and each time getting to the 3rd/4th disc before finding something new. I WILL complete this, just bought the [digital edition on PS4](https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP0082-CUSA08918_00-FF9FORPS4BUNDLE1?smcid=pdc%3Aus-en%3Aweb-pdc-games-final-fantasy-ix-digital-edition-ps4%3Aleadproductinfo-buy-download%3Anull%3A). Noice.

# Condition

Comes complete with the strategy guide leaflet and feedback leaflet, both of which are rare to see when you go on eBay. Overall mint conditon

No cracks to the case, just light marks only

Manual looks mint, no creases. Same goes for the leaflets.

Discs have hardly any scratches.
