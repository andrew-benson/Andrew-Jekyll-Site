# Notes

This is a rare demo that I've owned since as far as I can remember but it's never been at the forefront of my attention, not up until recently. I don't remember how I acquired this or when, it's just been... there. From what little information I have found on this it appears it has come from a [Total Play magazine issue](https://powerlineoeupsmfanclub.fandom.com/wiki/MediEvil_Collector%27s_Edition). I had a look to see if anyone on the internet had one like it, I found [this thread from reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/b66yq9/i_was_going_through_my_old_games_and_found_this/) and this [eBay listing](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/MEDIEVIL-COLLECTORS-EDITION-Playstation-PS1-Demo-Disc-in-Original-Card-Case/254580223557?hash=item3b4629ee45:g:waUAAOSwtZpeW5AV) asking for Â£40. Considering this is a demo, forty of the queens british pounds is a lot to ask for. But if you [the seller] are the only one on eBay or on the entire internet selling one of these, then you can dictate what the value is. In the event someone else wanted to sell theirs, they would most likely look at what someone else is asking for. 

With items like this it's hard to predict how many are left in the world but judging by the amount of information or sell listings, combined with the age, I'll take a guess and say less than a few hundred.

It comes in a red case, and to iterate what I said before as long as I've known it's always been housed in this. I really can't say wether this is the original case. My inital thought was perhaps whoever I got it off thought it would be a good idea to put it in a red case, but on the other hand who would want to do that and isn't a red jewel case just as rare as the demo itself. Who the hell had a spare red jewel case lying round in 1998? Not me. If anyone reading this can help me solve the mystery of the red jewel case then please [contact me]({% link contact.markdown %}).


# Condition

The case has light scratches on it. The disc has light scratches scratches here and there, but for the majority of the surface area there are none.

note: this is not from the collectors edition, it is from an American Pizza Hut demo.
As if Pizza Hut used to release PS1 games :)
