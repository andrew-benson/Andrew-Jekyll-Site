# Notes

This is the black case variant, I also have the less-rare [blue case] variant. Black cases are from the original first print of the game, that said some games were not released with a black case to begin with.

This is one of the first titles for the PS2. I have fond memories of going to my friend James' house, he got the PS2 as soon as it came out back in the days of 2000 (this is where I discovered the wonders of SSX and Tekken) and I had the previlege of playing this game, I was blown away and rightly so. It's a fun game, though a short one. I've heard you can complete the game in a few hours but hey, it was Squaresoft's first go at a PS2 title. Maybe they were just testing the waters with this one. It feels like the result of a Final Fantasy/Streets of Rage cross over with a touch of RPG elements, I for one will remember this game and I'm happy to have it in my collection. One thing I will point out is how much Sion, the guy on the cover, looks quite like an older version of Sora from the Kindom Hearts series. Even their names are similar.
